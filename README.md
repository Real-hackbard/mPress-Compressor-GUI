MPRESS makes programs and libraries smaller, and decrease start time when the application loaded from a slow removable media or from the network. It uses in-place decompression technique, which allows to decompress the executable without memory overhead or other drawbacks; it also protects programs against reverse engineering by non-professional hackers. Programs compressed with MPRESS run exactly as before, with no runtime performance penalties.
MPRESS is absolutely free of charge software.
MPRESS uses own LZMAT - extremely fast data compression library.
Version 2.00 of the MATCODE Compressor has been released on 21st March 2009, now MPRESS has an optional LZMA compression.
in March 2011 Mr. DonDD has created and published his MPRESS GUI, see link below.

### LZMAT
LZMAT is an extremely fast real-time lossless data compression library!

LZMAT library v1.0 is written for x86 and x64 (AMD64) architectures. LZMAT_GUI is a 32bit Windows application which uses LZMAT compression library and demonstrates the compression speed. This program can be used to compress some big files or directories (i.e. VM images, disc images, for backup of some important folders,...).

LZMAT Features:
* Very fast compression-decompression
* Does not require memory for decompression
* Supports overlapping compression and in-place decompression
* Thread safe algorithm
* Written in ANSI C
* Small decompression procedure
* LMAT algorithms and implementation are distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) . Special licenses for commercial and other applications are available by contacting the author.
